A basic tutorial on scraping the world's knowledge.

Steps:
1. Clone the Knowledge Drone repo to your Mac from Github.
	- You may have to install the Github Mac app
2. Set your variables in KnowledgeDrone.py
3. Do the Terminal stuff below
	- Type out all the stuff below the dashes in your terminal unless it's in brackets.
	- Useful terminal commands:
		pwd - this tells you where you are
		cd [then a folder name] - navigates you to that folder
		cd .. - this takes you back one folder
		ls - this tells you what files are in the current directory
		sudo - this means superuser. if you ever get a permission denied error, use this.
4. Assemble the images into a PDF using Preview

	- I could have done this in Python but you would've had to install a bunch of complicated modules
